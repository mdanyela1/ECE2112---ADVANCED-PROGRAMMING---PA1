#1:ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM: Create a function that takes a string and rturns a string with its letters in alphabetical order.
- This project solves the **Alphabet Soup Problem**:  A function that takes a string and returns a new string with its letters sorted in **alphabetical order**.  

# Description  
- The program asks the user to input a word.  
- It rearranges the letters of the word in alphabetical order.  
- Sorting is **case-insensitive**, but the original letter case is preserved in the result. 
-------------------------------------

#2:EMOTICON PROBLEM: Create a function that changes specific words into emoticons. Given a sentence as a string, replace the words smile, grin, sad and mad with their corresponding emoticon.
- This project solves the **Emoticon Problem**: A Python function that takes a sentence as input and replaces specific words with their corresponding **emoticons**.  

# Description 
The function scans a sentence and replaces the following words:  

- `smile → :)`  
- `grin → :D`  
- `sad → :((`  
- `mad → >:(`  
This makes text-based conversations more fun and expressive! 

-----------------------------------------

#3:UNPACKING LIST PROBLEM: Unpack the list write your code here into three variables, being first, middle, and last, with middle being everything in between the first and last element. Then print all three variables.
- This project solves the **Unpacking List Problem**: A Python program that unpacks a list into three variables:  
- `first` → the first element  
- `middle` → all elements between the first and last  
- `last` → the final element

# Description
Given a list, the program extracts its parts using **list indexing and slicing**:  

-----------------------------------------------
# How to run
1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed on your computer.  
2. Save each problem in its own file:  
   - `alphabet_soup.py` → for Problem 1  
   - `emoticon.py` → for Problem 2  
   - `unpacking_list.py` → for Problem 3  
3. Open a terminal (or command prompt) in the folder where the files are saved.  
4. Run the program using:  

```bash
python filename.py
